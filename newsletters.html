I trust this finds you in good health. We'll be holding the 2026 AGM in the
shack, at 12.30 on Friday 9th January. Those who can’t make it in person can join us
online, please contact Paul for a link/invite: p.a.maher666@gmail.com.<p>
A big welcome to new members, Emma Street, and David Tatlow, M1BEO.
We’re very sorry to report the passing of one of the club’s founder members, Tom
Mitchell G3LMX, in October 2025. In fact, Tom was number two on our membership
list back when we started in 1990, number one being Ted Fountaine, G0CGC, also
silent key. Tom worked for the BBC, in the days when they had studios and a large
number of staff on the OU campus. Tom’s son, G7SIV, was also an OUARC
member. Tom was very keen and active on amateur television, and was a volunteer
at the RSGB’s National Radio Centre in Bletchley Park.<p>
The FTdx10 has been interfaced to the shack PC, so the logging program
(Log4OM) follows the radio’s frequency and mode. We’ve also made up the
required cables so it can drive the auto antenna switch, plus amplifier switching and
keying, so it’s fully “plumbed in”, (cable swaps select between the K3 and FTdx10).
We’ve used the old four way manual antenna switch to route the selected antenna
to either the K3, KX3 or FTdx10.<p>
Early in the year we completed a Risk Assesment, approved and signed off,
that covered specific antenna work, and more generally, mast telescoping and
luffing. This enabled us to compete some outstanding antenna work towards the
end of January – refitting the G3OU mesh node, and the Topband inverted L. Ian,
G4JXZ rebuilt the node into a more weather tight enclosure, and replaced the
antenna with a higher gain one (8dB), so improving the node’s range. We decided to
keep it on a halyard, rather than fixing it to the mast strut, which makes for easier
maintenance without having to drop the mast. Ian continues to maintain the node
and keep the software updated.<p>
The Topband (160m) antenna works well on transmit, and has worked across
to the States, but is very noisy on receive, typically S9 in 3kHz bandwidth, so a
receive antenna is the way to go. 80M is also very noisy, on the dipole, S7 in 3kHz,
but 40m, again on the dipole, is pretty quiet, S3 in 3kHz. There is interaction
between the Topband antenna and the 80/40m parallel dipoles, which affects the
resonances. The simple solution for now is to leave the Topband antenna unplugged
when not in use.<p>
Regarding antennas, in April we installed a vertically polarised delta loop for
40m. This is fed a quarter wave down one leg, using balanced/tuned feeder. It’sinteresting doing comparisons between this and our 40m dipole. As expected, the
dipole wins out on UK and close by European signals, whereas the loop gives an
improvement on distant stations, due to it’s lower angle pattern. Very local (ground
wave) signals are much stronger on the loop, confirming the low take off angle.
Some workable signals on the loop are inaudible on the dipole, and vice versa.
Loops are generally said to give lower noise on receive. With this loop though, the
opposite is true, picking up more locally generated noise from nearby sources than
the high angle dipole. Unfortunately the OU campus, as with most built up areas
now, isn’t a low noise RF environment. Since the loop is fed with balanced feeder,
we can also use it on other bands, like 60m and 30m. We’ve had some contacts on
30m using the new loop (we’ve lacked a 30m antenna for some years), so that’s an
added bonus.<p>
I’m pleased to say that, as of September 2025, the G2OU callsign has been in
use from the club shack. Many thanks to David, M1BEO for sorting that out with
Ofcom.<p>
In September we set up the FTdx10 for the FT8 digital mode. All connections
for that being via a single USB cable, for both CAT and virtual audio. That’s
working very well, and the FT8 contacts are logged in our main logging program via
a UDP link (User Datagram Protocol). We have also been experimenting with WSPR
beacons, so far on 160m, 30m and 20m. The 20m and 30m beacons were running for
just a few minutes in the afternoon, and were picked up all over the world, with
multiple reports from New Zealand and Australia, and also west coast USA via long
path. On 160m we made it to Australia and the USA.<p>
We are hoping to get active on the QO100 geostationary satellite from the
club shack. Ian G4JXZ has put together his own system at home, so is looking into
the best options for us. Adrian has supplied a surplus five foot diameter dish that
we can use. The uplink is on 2.4GHz, with downlink on 10.45GHz.
The HF linear was finally repaired back in January. The intermittent fault
was traced to the vacuum relay, which is used for TX/RX antenna switching. We
obtained a used replacement (pulled from MRI equipment) for a good price, which
has solved the problem.
In March the club callsigns were active in the Worked All Prefixes SSB
contest, 250 contacts were made on the Saturday with GX3OU, with a further 300
contacts on the Sunday as GX0OUR. GX3 and GX0 are unusual prefixes, and were
virtually unique during the contest weekend, so counted as scoring multipliers for
most of the contacts. In May the CW leg of the same contest took place. 600 contacts
were made using GX3OU on the Saturday, and a further 400 as GX0OUR on the
Sunday, so a total of 1550 contacts in WPX 2025. In November, we were active in the
RSGB Club Calls contest, using the callsign GX3OU. Also in November, we aired
G2OU again, this time in the Hamspirit Contest, and the Bulgarian DX contest. Sinceditching paper logs and using the Log4OM logging program we’ve clocked up
around 3500 worldwide contacts using the club callsigns.<p>
In May, Jeff, Adrian and Fraser installed a pair of orthogonal receive loops.
These are relay switched by sending DC down the coax feeder using Bias Tees at
both ends. The loops work on all bands but are mainly useful on Topband due to
the very high noise level from the vertical transmit antenna. We notice around 10dB
improvement in noise floor, and about 6dB directivity when switching between the
loops. So a useful improvement. There is much scope for further improvement by
using unidirectional receive antennas (RDF: Receive Directivity Factor).
Unfortunately, in November, some ground works was carried out in the area, which
broke both loops, and buried our switchbox. Fortunately the feed cable, now buried,
appears undamaged, the switchbox was recovered and we’ve rigged up a temporary
receive loop.<p>
Also in May, Jeff, Caroline, Adrian and Fraser represented the club, alongside
the Astronomy Club, at a “Building the OU Community” event on the Mulberry
Lawn. It was a beautiful sunny day – the OU Gardening club plant sales won out in
the popularity stakes.<p>
All our equipment was PAT tested back in January by an OU contractor, and
no issues were found. Then in early July, we had our annual LOLER inspection
(Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations). The winches and winch
cables on both masts were checked and given a clean bill of health. It was the same
inspector as last year (Simon), who works on behalf of the OU’s insurers. Paul, Jeff,
Adrian and Fraser were on hand to take the wire antennas down, telescope down
the masts and luff them over, then reverse the process, which took most of the
morning. As it happened, we did not have any other antenna related jobs to do this
time while the masts were down.<p>
In July, several of us attended the OU Club AGM, which was held on Teams.
We submitted a report summarising our club’s activities, and also a shack photo for
the AGM slideshow.<p>
We were told some time back that the STEM server hosting g0our.open.ac.uk
was due to be shut down. Also that our website did not comply with the latest strict
guidelines (very hard for us to achieve in practice). The server was eventually shut
down in October. Paul has moved the site off campus, now at www.g0our.club, and
there is a redirect from the old OU URL for the time being. It seems sad that a long
standing affilliated club can no longer be supported in this way by the University,
but we have to accept the issues and the decision and move on.<p>
In December, the telnet firewall issue we’ve had ever since moving into our
new cabins, was finally resolved, thanks to very helpful IT staff. Until now we’ve
had to resort to WiFi connections to use the DX Cluster.<p>
That’s it for now, seasons greetings, hope to see you at the AGM.`

            content: `<h1>OPEN UNIVERSITY AMATEUR RADIO CLUB<br>NEWS LETTER no:52</h1><h2>G0OUR/G3OU Affiliated to the OU Club and the Radio Society of Great Britain</h2><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>I trust this finds you in good health.  We\'ll be holding the 2025 AGM in the shack, at 12.30 on Thursday 16th January.  Those who can’t make it in person can join us online, please contact Paul for a link/invite: <a href="mailto:p.a.maher666@gmail.com">p.a.maher666@gmail.com</a></p><p>Early in the year we completed a Risk Assesment covering general club activities, as requested by the OU Club.  This covers our Thursday lunchtime meetings, and general low level maintenance.  Antenna work that involves telescoping/luffing the towers is covered by specific RAMS for those activities.</p><p>Early this year we worked with IT and Estates to get access to The Cloud open WiFi network provided on the router in the shack.  As installed the router only gave access to secure staff systems.  This was finally completed after jumping through a few hoops.    This means we can now solve the telnet problem, by connecting the shack PC via Wi-Fi rather than Ethernet, although there is a Wi-Fi time-out (three hours?) so it’s not a fix for everything.</p><p>In July Estates organised for contractors to check the winches and cables on our telescopic towers.  A representative from the OU insurers was also present to check compliance with LOLER (Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998), along with representatives from Estates.  Everything checked out okay and we were given a clean bill of health.  While the masts were down and partially luffed over, we were able to carry out some quick maintenance tasks.  This included freeing up the LF dipole that had got stuck in a tree.  Both ends of the 40m and 80m have been tethered to new positions, and the dipoles are finally back properly in operation.  On the HD P60, we were able to replace the rope that supports the slack coax. cable around the rotator.  The old rope had broken.  All in all a very successful day.</p><p>More recently we installed a Topband (160m) inverted L antenna, which is working well, although is very noisy on receive (S8 in SSB bandwidth).  We have used separate receive antennas in the past so will revisit this.  The Topband antenna is fairly close to the 80/40m dipoles, and there is some interaction, so we need to retune those antennas.</p><p>Adrian has been approached by the keeper of historic callsign G2OU.  This had been used by Farmor’s School Radio Club.  The callsign holder has now retired and the school club disbanded, so we were offered the callsign for the OUARC.  This was very welcome news and we are persuing this with Ofcom.</p><p>We welcome back Alan Wyatt G2DXU into the club.  Alan was a member in the distant past, but became inactive on the radio for a while due to a house move.</p><p>Thank you to Adrian for  manning a stall at the OU Well-being drop-in event.  Adrian was also representing the OU Astronomy club, and reported a fair amount of interest, although mostly for the Astronomy club!</p><p>Our HF linear amplifier still has an annoying intermittent fault which is proving difficult to track down.  Something on the RF output side is arcing internally (nothing visible),  which usually trips out the amplifier immediately, or if not badly distorts the signal.  This happens on all bands regardless of antenna, or into a dummy load, and usually when the amplifier has warmed up (which doesn’t take long, especially in summer).   Using Adrian’s ‘scope we’ve checked out all the supply/bias rails, and found no problems there.    We’ll continue fault finding as time permits.</p><p>In August Ian G4JXZ provided a Meshtastic 868MHz 150mW node which we have temporarily fitted to P60 mast.  This is a light weight low power transceiver/node, attached to a 4dB gain colinear vertical antenna.  As it’s so small and light weight we were able to just attach the whole thing to a spare halyard and pull it up to near the top of the P60 mast.  The only connection being a 12V supply cable, which converts down to a 5V USB supply at the node.  It can be controlled locally by Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, or remotely, e.g. from Ian’s house (~8 miles away).  The node worked immediately and Ian showed us a map of other nodes it could see being populated on his smart phone.  This node appears on the network as G3OU.</p><p>Thank you to Ian for providing the following detailed description:</p><p>Many people have not heard of mesh networking, but it is becoming used increasingly in home Wi-Fi systems for interconnection of nodes, relying on each device acting as a router for other devices, creating a mesh which self-heals and does not rely upon point-to-point connections.</p><p>Well, the Internet of Things (IOT) also relies upon this type of connectivity for most applications. IOT is generally used for the management of a group or multiple, interconnected groups of devices, mainly designed to pass telemetry data back to a main source, or between each other. It is often used in home automation systems to great effect. LoRA, as it is known (meaning Long-Range, although this has to be put into context) uses the licence-free public bands of 433MHz and 868MHz, of which 868MHz is the most popular. 433MHz tends to be cluttered with spurious transmissions from automatic garage door systems, gate openers, car tyre pressure sensors, home outside weather stations, etc. The max eirp permitted is 27dBM or around 500mW. The system is unique in that is uses ‘Chirp’ Spread Spectrum modulation. There is a Meshtastic group who publish really helpful info, and good link to an introduction on the meshtastic.org website.   </p><p>Well, a group of techs got together, (initially in the USA, I believe) and decided that this may be a suitable system in which to pass short messages, without relying upon any infrastructure, such as the internet or mobile phone networks. Off-grid, so to speak. They gave it the name “Meshtastic”. (Now you can see why I believe that it was developed in the USA). It is an open source project with software and data available on GitHub.</p><p>The devices themselves are tiny and also have full Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity for remote management.    </p><p>At the moment, I am operating a node in Cranfield (CFD) to try and link Bedford and MK. It has a full node list of 100 user nodes most of the time.  The 868MHz node is on the arm sticking out top-right with a 6dBi gain colinear, the 433MHz test node is using my dual-band 2m/70cm colinear at the top.</p><p>The unit installed at Walton Hall is identical to the 868MHz node and has been operating for some time. It also has a high node count of around 40 nodes currently. Its node name is G3OU. It is mounted temporarily atop one of the two towers while it is tested, but will be re-affixed to a more permanent location if found worthwhile. Remote management of nodes is possible over the mesh network using Python commands, although I am setting up a remote management and data link using the protocol MQTT (Message Queueing for Telemetry Transport), an original IBM IOT protocol used on most domestic home management systems.</p><p>The nodes are great for portable use, linking to your phone via Bluetooth so you can send and provide detailed maps with location and node lists and any other telemetry traffic that the node is equipped to measure.</p><p>The hop count can be adjusted from 0 to 7. The OU is set to a hop count of 3 (recommended value) Max eirp is 27dBm or about 500mW on 868MHz. It is 12dBM or 16mW on the 433MHz band.  Range is, like all VHF/UHF systems, dependent upon height and terrain. Mine can cover up to about 15-20km line of sight unless a lift is on, in which case it can be 120km. The record for 868MHz in UK is about 200-odd km, but that is usually from a mountain top with a yagi. </p><p>That’s all for now and I hope it has provided a brief overview of the Meshtastic system, which is a good source of topics for research. There are papers online describing the Chirp spread spectrum, if you are mathematically inclined. I will put more information in the next newsletter with news on new developments, and how our node at Walton Hall is doing.</p><p>All the best and a very merry Christmas and happy New Year to all!</p><p>Ian Terrell G4JXZ</p>`

Those who can’t make it in person can join us online, contact Paul for details <a href="mailto:p.a.maher666@gmail.com">p.a.maher666@gmail.com</a></p><p>Our last paper log ran out on 12th Jan 2023, and we’ve finally moved over to PC logging, currently using both the Log4OM and N1MM freeware programs.  G3OU has been active in various contests, including the ARRL DX contest, Belgian UBA, GC - Yuri Gagarin,  WPX (Worked All Prefixes, as GX3OU).  We’ve also generated some small pile ups using the GX3OU callsign outside of contests.</p><p>This year we welcome back to the club ex member Ian G0TLB, who has been living abroad since leaving the OU.  In the past, Ian was largely responsible for setting up and running the club’s packet node, complete with internet gateway.  Ian returned to the UK this year and has taken up a post at Bristol Uni.  We’re also pleased to welcome back Linda, M0CMK who has rejoined the club.  Linda used to be very active from the OU shack when she lived in MK, and was our QSL manager for many years.</p><p>This year we’re pleased to welcome five new members.  Ian, G4JXZ who is ex OU staff, now retired.  Ian was very helpful along with Adrian M0ANS, in setting up our new shack and storage cabin, moving kit, assembling shelving units and so on.  Caroline M6BGY of OU LDS, who is interested in natural emissions (Whistlers) on VLF.  Laurence G4SXH who is an OU Associate Lecturer.   Rodney Buckland M0RBX, also an OU Associate Lecturer.  And finally OU graduate Mike, G4UPD.</p><p>Following the membership of Lawrence and Rodney, at their suggestion we’ve been in discussions regarding the club’s further involvement in the T312 module, Electronics, Signal Processing, Control and Communications.  Adrian and Ian have met with Dimitar, the module Chair, and were given a tour of the Virtual Labs (the physical ones on campus).  They have a high end National Instruments SDR which Dimitar brought to the shack.</p><p>To simplify communication between members, our Secretary Adrian has set up two io groups:  <a href="mailto:ouarc@groups.io">ouarc@groups.io</a> and <a href="mailto:OUARC-T312@groups.io">OUARC-T312@groups.io</a>.   Contact Adrian if you wish to join either or both groups, <a href="mailto:adrianrawlings@gmail.com">adrianrawlings@gmail.com</a></p><p>Congratulations to Paul, M0OOM who retired from the OU in the Summer.  Paul was our treasurer, a role that has to be carried out by a staff member. Al, KI6QFJ, who works in STEM has now taken on the role of treasurer for us, and Paul has agreed to continue as deputy.  Congratulations also to Jeff, 2E1OUJ (ex M3OUJ), who also retired from the OU this Summer.</p><p>It’s been several years since we lost our LF antennas on the M100 mast, and more recently the new 80m dipole was broken by contractors before we even had a chance to use it.  I’m pleased to say that, back in May, we erected a pair of nested dipoles, for the 80m and 40m bands, suspended from the P60 just below the Hexbeam.  These are fed with coax via a ferrite choke balun at the feed point.  There was just enough room, now that the trees have been trimmed back, to tilt that tower over, so we could do the work safely at ground level.  Unfortunately we caused a bit of a fuss with one end of the dipoles tethered near the Security Lodge.  Even though we’d used those tether points for years (decades) in the past, they apparently now represented a security, or H&amp;S risk (we’re not sure which), so we had to remove them.  However, Estates very kindly offered to have a dedicated post erected to tether the dipole support lines to.   Unfortunately though the contractors didn’t put the post where we’d specified it to be, so the 40m dipole is now stuck in a tree.  We’ll have to see what we can do there.  In any case, moving the tether points has detuned the dipoles, so we’ll have to drop the tower down again to re-trim the wires.  A never ending saga it seems.</p><p>Thank you to Adrian for manning a stall at the OU Well-being drop-in event back in May.  Adrian was also representing the OU Astronomy club, and reported a fair amount of interest, although mostly for the Astronomy club!</p><p>Back in February we were approached by a researcher from Manchester Metropolitan University, who was doing research into amateur radio and what attracts people into the hobby, particularly youngsters.  Several of our members gave telephone interviews in aid of the project and we gave them some other useful leads.</p><p>We have an IT issue when using Telnet to connect to the DX Cluster.  Back in January Ian G0TLB diagnosed the fault, related to network address translation not maintaining the connection for more than a second or two.  The result is that our logging program(s) can connect to the Cluster, but then get disconnected again almost immediately.  This starts a cycle of continued connections and disconnections.     The problem has been reported to the OU IT department, and chased up, but there seems to be no enthusiasm by them to resolve it.  We can get round the problem by disconnecting from the OU network and tethering by Wi-Fi to a mobile phone, but it’s not an elegant or permanent solution.</p><p>On the equipment front. This year we traded in our ageing Icom IC7400 for a new Yaesu FTdx10.  This is a high performance hybrid SDR, which covers HF, 6m and also 4m.  Paul has connected it to one of our large monitors, and also fitted a mouse.  We will be sorting out cabling to interface it to the PC, antenna switching, amplifier and keyer.  Our old four way manual antenna switch is now used to switch the selected antenna to either the K3, KX3 or the FTdx10.</p><p>Our HF linear amplifier has developed an annoying intermittent fault which is proving difficult to track down.
